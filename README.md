# Indego Bike Share Analysis

The code in this project performs exploratory data analysis and some machine learning on data from the Indego Bike Share service. Since it is a public service, Indego makes its trip and station data free, openly available and documented at https://www.rideindego.com/about/data/.

Indego is a public bike share service owned by the City of Philadelphia. Bikes are taken from and returned to Indego stations. Each station consists of a high-tech kiosk and a set of bike docks operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Each kiosk manages anywhere from one dozen to five dozen docks. In 2018 Indego riders tool almost two-thirds of a million trips on over 1400 bikes available at 130 kiosks. A typical Indego station with kiosk, docks and bikes is shown in Figure 1.
