Troubleshooting
What if Iâ€™m involved in a crash?

If anyone is injured, call 911 immediately. You should also call the police department in the jurisdiction the crash took place and file a report with an officer. This will help assure all important information is documented.

Within 24 hours of the incident, you must notify us of the facts of the crash by calling Customer Service at 844-4-INDEGO (844-446-3346). The bike remains your responsibility until it has been properly locked at a dock, or handed over to an Indego representative. Otherwise, you must secure the bike until you are able to return it to Indego.
What if a bike I checked out has a problem?

If you check out a bike and it has a problem, please return the bike to the nearest Indego station and contact Customer Service at 844-4-INDEGO (844-446-3346) or support@rideindego.com immediately so we can lock down the bike for repair.
What if I damage a bike?

Indego bikes are going to experience regular wear and tear, and we have a team of mechanics working to keep the system in good working order. However, if you cause obvious damage to an Indego bike, you are responsible for the cost of repair. Please report damage by emailing support@rideindego.com or by calling Customer Service at 844-4-INDEGO (844-446-3346).
What if my key is lost or stolen?

You are responsible for any bike checked out with your Indego Key, as detailed in the User Agreement. If you lose your Indego Key, call Customer Service immediately at 844-4-INDEGO (844-446-3346) so we can suspend the Key to prevent anyone else from using it. Replacement Keys are $5.
What if my bike is lost or stolen?

Immediately notify us by calling 844-4-INDEGO (844-446-3346). You must do this within 24 hours. The Customer Service representative you speak with will ask you to fill out an Indego Theft Report form. In addition, we request that you call or visit the police precinct in which the theft occurred within 24 hours to file a theft report. Your account may be charged for the cost of recovery or replacement of the bike. Please note, you must contact Indego within 24 hours of the loss or theft of your Indego bike.
